# Go Agents

A platform and model agnostic Go agent primitive library.

## Documentation

- **[ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)**: Technical specifications and implementation details
- **[_context/](./_context/)**: Implementation guides and development summaries

## Current Implementation

The package provides a complete multi-protocol LLM integration system with a mature protocol-centric architecture:

- **Complete Protocol Support**: All four core protocols (chat, vision, tools, embeddings) fully operational with structured content handling and streaming support
- **Format-Agnostic Provider System**: Providers support any capability format (OpenAI, Anthropic, native APIs) without modification
- **Protocol-Centric Architecture**: Clean separation between protocols, capabilities, model formats, providers, and transport layers
- **Structured Content Support**: Vision protocol handles both text and complex multimodal content with automatic image encoding
- **Multiple Provider Integration**: Working Ollama and Azure AI Foundry providers with authentication (API keys, Entra ID)
- **Enhanced Development Tools**: Command-line testing infrastructure with comprehensive protocol examples and improved output formatting
- **Configuration-Driven Behavior**: Runtime flexibility through configuration without code changes
- **Thread-Safe Operations**: Proper connection pooling, streaming, and concurrent request handling

## Development Status

### Current Phase: Protocol Architecture Optimization

**Completed**: Full multi-protocol system operational with vision fixes, enhanced embeddings output, and comprehensive documentation updates.

**Active Focus**: Address protocol option validation conflicts to enable composable capabilities architecture documented in `_context/composable-capabilities.md`.

**Next Session**: Implement protocol-centric capability composition to resolve option isolation and enable fine-grained capability control.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.25 or later
- For Ollama: at a minimum, Docker. If you have an NVIDIA GPU, you'll want to install the `nvidia-container-toolkit` package and [configure Docker for CDI to work with the NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://github.com/JaimeStill/LinuxNotes/tree/main/omarchy#configure-docker-for-cdi-to-work-with-nvidia-container-toolkit). If you just have Docker, you can still run and fallback to CPU processing, but your performance will be noticeably bad.
- For Azure: you will need to have the Azure CLI installed and authenticated to a tenant where you have [created the necessary infrastructure](./scripts/azure/README.md) to connect to a deployed Azure OpenAI model.

### Basic Usage

The `tools/prompt-agent/` utility provides command-line testing of provider implementations. See the [tools/prompt-agent/README](./tools/prompt-agent/README.md) for comprehensive documentation.

#### Test with Ollama (local models)

You will first need to ensure you startup the Docker container:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

This will automatically pull down the `llama3.2:3b` model and store it in a volume pointed to `~/.ollama`. Once the model is downloaded, you are good to prompt.

```sh
# Test with Ollama (local)
go run tools/prompt-agent/main.go \
  -config tools/prompt-agent/config.ollama.json \
  -prompt "In 300 words or less, describe the Go programming language" \
  -stream # optional, removing will process all at once and return
```

##### Output

Kubernetes, often abbreviated as K8s, is an open-source container orchestration platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It abstracts the underlying infrastructure by organizing containers into the smallest deployable units called pods, which run on nodes (servers) grouped into clusters.

At its core, Kubernetes uses a declarative configuration model, allowing developers to define the desired state of their applications through configuration files. The system then continuously works to ensure that the actual state matches the desired one, providing self-healing capabilities such as automatic restarts, rescheduling of failed containers, and load balancing.

Key features include automated rollouts and rollbacks, horizontal scaling, service discovery, and management of persistent storage. Kubernetes also supports advanced networking policies and security configurations, making it a robust platform for managing microservices architectures. Its API-driven design enables seamless integrations with other cloud-native tools and services, fostering a vibrant ecosystem of extensions and custom controllers.

By decoupling application logic from infrastructure concerns, Kubernetes provides a consistent environment across different deployment landscapesâ€”whether on public clouds, on-premises data centers, or hybrid environments. This flexibility, along with its community-driven evolution and support from major cloud providers, has made Kubernetes the de facto standard for orchestrating containerized applications in modern cloud-native environments.

##### Output

OAuth (Open Authorization) is an open standard for delegated authorization. It enables third-party applications to access user resources on a service without requiring users to share their credentials. Instead, the user grants a permission token (access token) that defines what resources the application can access, and for how long. OAuth focuses solely on resource authorization, not user identity verification.

OIDC (OpenID Connect) builds on OAuth 2.0 by introducing an additional layer for user authentication. While OAuth provides secure authorization for resource access, OIDC adds the means to verify a user's identity. It does this through an ID tokenâ€”a JSON Web Token (JWT) that carries information about the user and the authentication event. OIDC simplifies user login and enables applications to obtain basic user profile information, ensuring that the user is who they claim to be.

In summary, OAuth is primarily used to grant limited access to user data without exposing login credentials, making it ideal for authorizing actions like posting on social media or accessing personal data. In contrast, OIDC is perfect for scenarios where both authentication (verifying the user's identity) and authorization (granting permission to access resources) are needed. Together, they allow modern applications to securely manage access and provide a streamlined user experience by reducing the need for additional credentials.

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Impression:**

The image is a striking and surreal digital painting that evokes a sense of ancient mystery, serenity, and perhaps a touch of melancholy. Itâ€™s highly stylized with dramatic lighting and a focus on texture.

**Key Elements:**

* **Statue of Buddha:** The focal point is a massive, weathered statue of the Buddha. It's depicted in a traditional pose, with one arm raised in a gesture of blessing. The statue is covered in moss and lichen, giving it an aged, almost ethereal quality.  The details of the face are soft, suggesting time and the elements have worn it smooth.
* **Waterfall:** A powerful waterfall dominates the background. The water cascades down with impressive force, creating a dramatic spray and a sheet of light that illuminates the statue. The water is rendered with a sense of motion and volume.
* **Figure:** A small, solitary figure â€“ a person dressed in a bright orange garment â€“ stands on the statueâ€™s hand. They appear tiny in comparison to the immense scale of the statue and the waterfall, emphasizing the theme of humility or contemplation.
* **Birds:** Several birds, rendered in white, are flying around the statue and the waterfall, adding a touch of life and movement to the scene.

**Color and Lighting:**

* **Dominant Colors:** The color palette is dominated by cool tones â€“ greens, blues, and grays. This contributes to the sense of age, serenity, and perhaps a slight sadness.
* **Lighting:** The lighting is dramatic, with a strong light source coming from the waterfall, creating a bright, almost holy glow around the statue. This highlights the textures and adds a sense of depth and scale.

**Style and Mood:**

* **Digital Painting Style:** The image has a highly detailed, almost painterly digital painting style.  The use of texture and light gives it a realistic yet fantastical quality.
* **Mood:**  The overall mood is contemplative and slightly melancholic. It suggests themes of peace, time, and the impermanence of things. It feels like a place of quiet reflection and ancient wisdom.
