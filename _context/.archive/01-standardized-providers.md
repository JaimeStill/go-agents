# Standardized Provider Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the completed development effort to establish OpenAI-compatible provider implementations in the agentic-toolkit, including key implementation decisions, final architecture state, and remaining challenges.

## Starting Point

### Initial Architecture
The project began with a legacy implementation using provider-specific API formats:
- Ollama provider using native `/api/generate` endpoint with custom request/response structures
- System prompt management scattered across LLM and agent layers
- Provider-specific model types in `pkg/providers/ollama/models.go`
- Legacy completion-based interface methods (`Complete()`, `Stream()`)

### Key Limitations
- No standardization across providers
- Complex translation layers between different API formats
- Inconsistent error handling across providers
- Brittle provider implementations tied to specific API versions

## Implementation Decisions

### OpenAI Standard Adoption
**Decision**: Adopt OpenAI Chat Completions API format as the single unified standard for all providers.

**Rationale**: 
- Ollama natively supports OpenAI-compatible endpoints (`/v1/chat/completions`)
- Azure AI Foundry implements OpenAI-compatible APIs
- Eliminates need for translation layers
- Simplifies maintenance and testing
- Industry standard format with broad ecosystem support

### System Prompt Architecture
**Decision**: Move system prompt management from LLM layer to agent layer.

**Implementation**: 
- Removed `SystemPrompt()` method from LLM client interface
- Agent layer injects system prompts as first message in conversation array
- Clean separation between transport (LLM) and business logic (agent)

### Configuration Management Pattern
**Decision**: Implement DefaultConfig + Merge pattern for robust configuration handling.

**Implementation**:
- `llm.DefaultConfig()` and `agent.DefaultConfig()` provide sensible defaults
- `Merge()` methods allow hierarchical configuration override
- `agent.LoadConfig()` handles file loading with default fallbacks
- Prevents runtime failures from missing configuration values

### Interface Standardization
**Decision**: Replace legacy completion methods with OpenAI-compatible Chat methods.

**Changes**:
- `Complete()` → `Chat(ctx context.Context, request *ChatRequest)`
- `Stream()` → `ChatStream(ctx context.Context, request *ChatRequest)`
- Unified request/response structures across all providers

### Provider Registry Enhancement
**Decision**: Implement factory pattern with default provider registration.

**Implementation**:
- Thread-safe provider registration and lookup
- Default providers (Ollama, Azure) registered automatically
- Runtime provider management capabilities
- Clean separation of provider creation from usage

## Implementation Details

### Core Type System
Established OpenAI-compatible types in `pkg/llm/models.go`:
- `Message` struct for conversation entries
- `ChatRequest` for unified request format
- `ChatResponse` for standard response structure
- `StreamingChunk` for streaming response format
- Helper methods with encapsulation principles (`ExtractContent()`, `Content()`)

### Ollama Provider Refactoring
- Migrated from `/api/generate` to `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint
- Implemented OpenAI-compatible request/response handling
- Added proper HTTP client configuration with connection pooling
- Implemented health checking with cached status
- Added semantic error mapping from HTTP status codes

### Azure AI Foundry Provider Implementation
- Dual authentication support (API key and Entra ID Bearer tokens)
- Deployment-specific configuration via Options map
- Azure-specific error response parsing
- Integration with cognitive services endpoints
- Configuration validation and credential extraction

### Error Handling System
Implemented hierarchical semantic error types:
- `LLMValidationError` for configuration and input validation
- `LLMNetworkError` for connection and transport failures
- `LLMAuthError` for authentication issues
- `LLMModelError` for model-specific problems
- `LLMTemporaryError` for retryable failures

Each error type includes provider context, model information, and structured error details.

### Testing Infrastructure
Developed `tools/prompt-agent/` command-line utility:
- Agent-based configuration with hierarchical loading
- Support for both streaming and non-streaming modes
- Authentication token override capabilities
- Formatted output with response metadata and token usage
- Real-world testing of provider implementations

### Encapsulation Principles
Established data access patterns:
- Semantic methods for complex nested structure access
- Avoidance of direct field access patterns
- Intention-revealing method names over implementation exposure
- Built-in validation and error handling in accessor methods

## Final Architecture State

### Working Components
- **Ollama Provider**: Fully functional with OpenAI-compatible endpoints, streaming support, and proper error handling
- **Azure Provider**: Functional with both authentication methods and proper configuration handling
- **Configuration System**: Robust default handling with merge capabilities
- **Agent Layer**: System prompt management and basic agent primitives
- **Testing Tools**: Command-line validation with multiple provider support

### Provider Registry
- Factory pattern implementation with thread-safe operations
- Default provider registration for Ollama and Azure
- Runtime provider management capabilities
- Clean separation of provider instantiation from usage

### Configuration Management
- Hierarchical configuration with JSON file support
- Default value handling preventing runtime failures
- Merge pattern enabling configuration composition
- Authentication credential management through Options map

## Current Blockers

### Azure Model Compatibility Issue
**Problem**: The Azure provider encounters parameter compatibility differences based on model type within the same platform.

**Specific Issue**: Reasoning models (o1/o3 series) require `max_completion_tokens` parameter, while traditional models use `max_tokens`.

**Example**:
```
Azure o3-mini error: "Unsupported parameter: 'max_tokens' is not supported with this model. Use 'max_completion_tokens' instead."
```

**Architectural Implications**: This reveals that API format requirements vary by model, not just by provider, challenging the current provider-based abstraction model.

### Model vs Provider Abstraction Challenge
**Issue**: The current architecture assumes consistent API formats within each provider, but evidence shows format variations based on model capabilities within the same provider platform.

**Impact**: 
- Simple provider-based abstraction may be insufficient
- Need for model-aware format handling
- Potential requirement for format abstraction layer separate from provider abstraction

## Development Outcomes

### Successful Implementations
- OpenAI-compatible interface standardization across providers
- Robust configuration management with default handling
- Clean separation of transport and business logic layers
- Comprehensive error handling with semantic types
- Working provider implementations for primary use cases

### Architecture Improvements
- Eliminated provider-specific translation layers
- Simplified maintenance through standardization
- Enhanced testability through command-line tools
- Improved error visibility through structured error types

### Testing and Validation
- Manual testing infrastructure providing rapid validation
- Multi-provider configuration support
- Authentication flexibility for different deployment scenarios
- Real-world usage validation through command-line tools

## Next Development Phase

The Azure model compatibility issue identified during testing indicates the need for a message format abstraction layer that can handle model-specific API variations within providers. This represents the logical next phase of development to complete the foundational LLM integration architecture.

The current provider abstraction successfully handles transport concerns (authentication, networking, error handling) but requires extension to handle format concerns (request structure, parameter naming, response parsing) at a more granular level than provider-based abstraction allows.
