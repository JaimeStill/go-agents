# Capability-Layered Architecture Development Summary

## Starting Point

The project began with a basic client-provider separation architecture where agents directly interfaced with LLM providers. The system lacked clear separation between transport concerns and capability handling, with tightly coupled components that made extensibility and testing difficult.

## Implementation Decisions

### Phase 1: Interface-Driven Package Layers
- Established package dependency hierarchy: config → capabilities → models → providers → transport → agent
- Implemented contract interface pattern with ModelInfo interface for clean package boundaries
- Created foundation-level config package with no dependencies
- Separated model definitions from provider implementations

### Phase 2: Provider and Transport Separation
- Refactored provider implementations to focus solely on API communication
- Created transport layer as abstraction over provider operations
- Implemented PrepareRequest/PrepareStreamRequest pattern for different streaming protocols
- Established SetHeaders pattern for authentication without error returns
- Added ClientRequest parameter encapsulation for Execute operations

### Phase 3: Multi-Capability Testing Interface
- Updated tools/prompt-agent to work with new architecture
- Implemented support for testing all 7 capability types from command line
- Created configuration migration from old "client" structure to new "transport" structure
- Provided comprehensive CLI interface supporting completion, reasoning, embeddings, vision, tools, audio, realtime

### Critical Bug Fixes
- Fixed data type mismatch between transport layer (expecting request structures) and capability formats (expecting raw data)
- Updated all capability formats to accept CompletionRequest, EmbeddingsRequest, VisionRequest structures
- Resolved streaming response processing issue where transport expected capabilities.StreamingChunk values but received *capabilities.StreamingChunk pointers
- Corrected Ollama provider endpoint mapping to use proper /v1/chat/completions paths

## Final Architecture State

The system now features a clean layered architecture with:

- **Contract Interface Pattern**: Lower-level packages define minimal interfaces that higher-level packages implement
- **Unidirectional Dependencies**: Clear package hierarchy with no circular dependencies
- **Transport Abstraction**: Clean separation between HTTP communication and capability logic
- **Capability Consistency**: All formats handle request structures uniformly
- **Working Streaming**: Full support for real-time response streaming across providers
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Unified interface supporting Ollama, Azure, OpenAI, and others
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive CLI tool for validating all capabilities

Key architectural patterns implemented:
- Provider interface with PrepareRequest/PrepareStreamRequest methods
- ModelInfo contract interface for capability-model communication
- ClientRequest encapsulation for transport operations
- Format-specific option extraction with defaults and type safety

## Current Blockers

### Capability Consolidation Opportunity
The current architecture treats Completion, Reasoning, and Tools as separate capabilities, but they share identical execution patterns and only differ in option handling. This creates unnecessary complexity:

- Three separate capability enums for essentially the same operation (text generation from messages)
- Duplicate transport methods (Complete, CompleteStream could be unified)
- Model-specific capability switching instead of transparent format-based option adaptation

### Immediate Technical Debt
- Reasoning capability requires dedicated transport methods to avoid "capability not supported" errors
- Tools capability integration needs refinement for better developer experience
- prompt-agent capability flag needs proper reasoning model support

The architecture is stable and functional, but the capability layer presents an opportunity for significant simplification through format-based consolidation rather than operation-based separation.
