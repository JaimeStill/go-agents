# Development Summary: Protocol-Oriented Capabilities Implementation

## Starting Point

The project had a capability system with foundational structures but lacked proper protocol-oriented architecture. The existing implementation included:

- Basic capability interfaces in `pkg/capabilities/`
- Provider implementations in `pkg/providers/azure.go` and `pkg/providers/ollama.go`
- Transport client in `pkg/transport/client.go`
- Model definitions in `pkg/models/`

The goal was to implement a protocol-oriented capability system following the `_context/protocol-oriented-capabilities.md` implementation guide.

## Implementation Progress

### Steps 1-3: Core Architecture Foundation
- Consolidated `BaseCapability` into `StandardCapability` to eliminate redundancy
- Renamed `StreamingStandardCapability` to `StandardStreamingCapability` for consistency
- Fixed critical interface typo: "DetectCompatiblity" â†’ "DetectCompatibility" that was causing compilation errors
- Split `ProcessOptions` into two distinct methods:
  - `ValidateOptions`: Pure validation without defaults
  - `ProcessOptions`: Validation with defaults application

### Steps 4-7: Capability Implementation
- Implemented `StandardCapability` with proper validation patterns
- Implemented `StandardStreamingCapability` for streaming support
- Added capability registration system
- Created model format associations with capabilities

### Steps 8-9: Client and Provider Integration
- Added `executeStream` method to client for streaming support
- Implemented missing provider methods:
  - `PrepareStreamRequest`
  - `ProcessStreamResponse`
- Cleaned up provider interfaces by removing redundant protocol parameters
- Updated Azure and Ollama providers with streaming capability support

### Step 10: ModelFormat Architecture Issue Discovery
During Step 10 implementation, a critical architectural flaw was identified: `ModelFormat` needed to specify exact capability implementations, not just protocols. The existing design used protocol-based selection with detection logic, which created complexity and maintenance issues.

## Implementation Decisions

### Architecture Simplification
- Moved from detection-based capability selection to intent-driven architecture
- Eliminated complex priority and compatibility detection systems
- Adopted provider-aligned patterns using unified request structures

### Validation Pattern
- Implemented positive specification validation (declare what you accept, not what you reject)
- Separated validation concerns from processing concerns
- Leveraged existing provider error handling rather than duplicating validation logic

### Interface Design
- Cleaned up method signatures to remove redundant parameters
- Ensured proper separation between protocol handling and capability execution
- Aligned with real provider API patterns

## Final Architecture State

The implementation reached Step 10 before architectural issues necessitated a redesign. Key components implemented:

- **Capability System**: Functional capability interfaces and base implementations
- **Provider Integration**: Updated Azure and Ollama providers with streaming support
- **Client Layer**: Enhanced transport client with capability selection and execution
- **Validation Framework**: Proper option validation and processing separation

## Current Blockers

### ModelFormat Architecture Limitation
The fundamental issue that halted progress was the ModelFormat design. The existing approach required complex detection logic to match requests to capabilities, creating maintenance overhead and unclear intent declaration.

### Request Structure Mixing
The original design mixed conversation content (messages) with execution parameters (options) in capability-specific request structures, diverging from standard provider patterns.

### Global Registry Complexity
The capability registry approach with priority-based selection created unnecessary complexity compared to explicit model format capability assignment.

## Resolution Path

The architectural issues identified during Step 10 led to the development of `_context/protocol-centric-architecture.md`, which addresses these blockers through:

- Direct ModelFormat capability ownership
- Unified `protocols.Request` structure with Messages + Options
- Single capability per protocol per model registration
- Intent-driven rather than detection-based capability selection

The protocol-centric approach eliminates the complexity discovered during the original implementation while maintaining the core architectural goals of the protocol-oriented system.
