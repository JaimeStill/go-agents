# Development Summary: Protocol-Centric Architecture and Vision Protocol Fixes

## Starting Point

The development session began with multiple critical protocol issues blocking effective multi-protocol usage:

**Vision Protocol Failure**: The vision capability was completely non-functional due to architectural limitations in the Message structure. The `Message.Content` field was restricted to `string` type, preventing structured content required for vision requests. Additionally, the VisionCapability implementation was destroying properly formatted structured content by serializing it with `fmt.Sprintf("vision_content:%v", content)`, rendering image data inaccessible to models.

**Poor Embeddings Output**: The embeddings protocol produced minimal, uninformative output that provided no insight into the generated vectors, showing only basic dimension count without vector data or statistical analysis.

**Protocol Option Validation Conflicts**: A fundamental architecture issue was identified where model-level options (like `top_p`) were being passed to all protocols, causing validation failures when protocols didn't support certain options. The specific error "unsupported option: top_p" occurred when the tools protocol received chat-specific options, indicating a deeper architectural problem with option isolation.

**ModelFormat Bundling Limitations**: The current ModelFormat approach bundled capabilities at the format level, creating rigid combinations that couldn't accommodate models with partial capability support (e.g., llama3.2:3b supporting chat and tools but not vision or embeddings).

## Implementation Decisions

**Vision Protocol Architectural Fix**: Implemented a three-part solution to enable structured message content:
1. **Message Structure Update**: Changed `Message.Content` from `string` to `any` type in `pkg/protocols/protocol.go` to support both simple text and structured content arrays
2. **VisionCapability Repair**: Removed destructive string serialization in `pkg/capabilities/vision.go`, preserving structured content integrity for proper OpenAI format compliance
3. **Image Encoding Enhancement**: Added comprehensive image handling in `tools/prompt-agent/main.go` with automatic base64 encoding for both local files and remote URLs, using `http.DetectContentType()` for MIME type detection

**Embeddings Display Enhancement**: Completely redesigned embeddings output formatting to provide meaningful information including vector value previews (first and last 5 elements), statistical analysis (min, max, mean), proper dimension display, and clear token usage reporting.

**Composable Capabilities Architecture Design**: Created comprehensive implementation guide at `_context/composable-capabilities.md` documenting a protocol-centric architecture transformation. This design inverts the current ModelFormat bundling approach to enable per-protocol capability composition with isolated options, explicit protocol support declaration, and provider-agnostic capability formats using semantic naming (openai-* indicating API standard compliance).

**Provider-Agnostic Image Processing**: Implemented unified image handling that works across providers by downloading remote images and encoding to base64 data URLs, ensuring compatibility with providers that only support embedded image data rather than URL references.

## Final Architecture State

**Fully Functional Vision Protocol**: Vision requests now work correctly with both local files and remote URLs. The structured content flows properly through the system, enabling models to receive and analyze actual image data rather than file paths or malformed content.

**Enhanced Multi-Protocol Support**: All four protocols (chat, vision, tools, embeddings) are operational with the current architecture. The vision fixes demonstrate that structured content can be properly handled within the existing system.

**Improved Developer Experience**: The embeddings output now provides useful vector analysis information, and image handling is transparent to users regardless of whether they provide local files or web URLs.

**Architecture Transition Documented**: Comprehensive planning documentation exists for migrating from the current ModelFormat bundling to a composable capabilities architecture that will resolve protocol option validation conflicts and enable fine-grained capability control.

**Maintained Backward Compatibility**: All changes were implemented without breaking existing functionality, preserving the current configuration format and agent interface while adding new capabilities.

## Current Blockers

**Protocol Option Validation Conflicts**: The fundamental issue causing "unsupported option: top_p" errors remains unresolved. Model-level options continue to be passed to all protocols, causing validation failures when protocols don't support certain parameters. The tools protocol specifically rejects options like `top_p` that are valid for chat but not relevant for tool execution.

**ModelFormat Architecture Limitations**: The current bundling approach still requires creating separate model formats for different capability combinations, leading to format proliferation and preventing flexible capability composition. Models cannot selectively enable/disable protocols or mix capability implementations from different formats.

**Implementation Gap**: While the composable capabilities architecture has been thoroughly designed and documented, it has not yet been implemented. The next development session will need to execute the protocol-centric transformation to resolve the underlying architectural issues.

**Configuration Migration Required**: Once the composable capabilities architecture is implemented, existing configurations will need to be updated from the current format-based structure to the new protocol-specific capability composition format.

The session successfully resolved the vision protocol blocking issue and enhanced the development infrastructure, while establishing a clear architectural roadmap for resolving the remaining protocol validation conflicts through composable capabilities implementation.
