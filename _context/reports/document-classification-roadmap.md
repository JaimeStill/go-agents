# Document Classification Service Roadmap

## Executive Summary

This roadmap outlines the development path for delivering a production-ready document classification service capable of detecting DoD security classification markings in documents. The service will be built using the go-agents primitive library as its foundation, with development organized into five phases that establish three core supplemental packages: document processing, agent orchestration, and service integration.

The approach leverages examples-driven development to validate patterns and reveal tooling requirements before committing to library abstractions. Each phase produces standalone, demonstrable value while building toward the complete classification service.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning the examples roadmap, two foundational efforts must be completed:

### 1. Observability Infrastructure

Agent execution tracing, decision logging, and confidence scoring capabilities must be integrated into the core library. This observability layer is critical for:
- Understanding agent behavior in production workflows
- Tuning agent performance in air-gapped environments
- Tracking confidence scores and decision evidence
- Debugging complex multi-agent interactions

The observability design will be planned in a dedicated session to ensure minimal performance overhead while providing comprehensive execution visibility.

### 2. Testing and Documentation

The core go-agents library requires comprehensive unit testing (80%+ coverage) and godoc documentation following Go conventions. This ensures a stable, well-documented foundation for building supplemental packages.

See `_context/mvp-completion.md` for detailed implementation plan.

## Strategic Context

### The Challenge

Our work occurs primarily in air-gapped classified network environments without access to standard internet tooling ecosystems. While we have access to cloud services and government-hosted AI models, we lack the extensive tooling platforms (LangChain, LangGraph, etc.) available in public internet environments.

### The Solution

Building a platform and model-agnostic agent primitive library in Go provides:

**Technical Advantages**:
- Native Go concurrency primitives for efficient agent coordination
- Type-safe interfaces with compile-time guarantees
- Minimal dependencies suitable for air-gapped deployment
- Direct binary deployment without runtime dependencies
- High performance for production workloads

**Architectural Advantages**:
- Composable primitives that can be orchestrated flexibly
- Clear separation between traditional programming (Go) and intelligent processing (agents)
- Token cost optimization through Go preprocessing
- Configuration-driven agent deployment suitable for containerized services

### Document Classification Use Case

The driving requirement is detecting security classification markings (Unclassified, Confidential, Secret, Top Secret) in documents by analyzing:
- Banner markings (document headers/footers)
- Portion markings (paragraph-level classifications)
- Overall document classification indicators

This real-world use case ensures practical utility and guides tooling development toward production requirements.

## Roadmap Phases

### Phase 1: Document Processing Foundation

**Goal**: Build reusable document → text context conversion capability.

**What We're Solving**: Documents in closed formats (PDF, Office documents, images) need to be converted to text context for agent analysis. This capability must work in air-gapped environments without external service dependencies.

**Technical Approach**:
- Pure Go implementation using OpenXML standard for Office documents
- Direct text extraction from PDFs without external services
- OCR-based processing for images
- Registry pattern for format-specific processors

**Business Value**:
- Reusable document processing library applicable beyond classification
- No external service dependencies or API costs
- Foundation for any document analysis workflow

**Deliverable**: `go-agents-document-context` package providing universal document → context conversion

### Phase 2: Agent Communication Primitives

**Goal**: Establish Go-native agent coordination patterns with state management.

**What We're Solving**: Complex workflows require agents to communicate, share state, and coordinate execution. LangGraph-style state management patterns need to be adapted to leverage Go's unique concurrency primitives.

**Technical Approach**:
- Sequential chains with state accumulation
- Parallel execution with fan-out/fan-in patterns
- Conditional routing based on state predicates
- Complex workflows with cycles, checkpoints, and recovery

**Business Value**:
- Flexible workflow patterns adaptable to various use cases
- Efficient execution using Go's goroutines and channels
- State tracking for debugging and auditing
- Foundation for multi-step intelligent processes

**Deliverable**: `go-agents-orchestration` package (partial) providing state management and composition patterns

### Phase 3: Multi-Hub Orchestration

**Goal**: Demonstrate hierarchical agent coordination with cross-hub messaging.

**What We're Solving**: Production systems require agents organized into coordination domains (global, task-specific, department-specific) with cross-domain communication and audit trails.

**Technical Approach**:
- Hub-based agent organization ported from research prototypes
- Pub/sub messaging within and across hubs
- Agent registration in multiple hubs with context-aware handlers
- Support for recursive composition (hubs managing sub-hubs)

**Business Value**:
- Scalable agent organization suitable for enterprise systems
- Clear audit trails through hub-based message logging
- Flexible coordination patterns supporting complex organizational structures
- Foundation for multi-team, multi-domain agent deployments

**Deliverable**: `go-agents-orchestration` package (complete) with hub coordination primitives

### Phase 4: HTTP Service Integration

**Goal**: Establish patterns for agent-backed HTTP services with containerization.

**What We're Solving**: Agents must be integrated into standard web service architectures for enterprise adoption. Services need containerization support for deployment flexibility across different environments.

**Technical Approach**:
- REST API patterns with agent processing
- Agent lifecycle management in service contexts
- Configuration-driven deployment with environment-specific settings
- Docker containerization with compose orchestration

**Business Value**:
- Standard HTTP interfaces for agent capabilities
- Deployment flexibility (air-gapped, cloud, hybrid)
- Configuration-driven environment adaptation
- Production-ready service patterns

**Deliverable**: `go-agents-services` package providing HTTP service primitives and containerization templates

### Phase 5: Full Integration

**Goal**: Deliver production-ready document classification service integrating all developed tooling.

**What We're Solving**: Demonstrate complete integration of document processing, agent orchestration, multi-hub coordination, and service deployment in a working production service.

**Architecture**:
1. HTTP endpoint receives document upload
2. Document processor extracts text (Go)
3. Sequential agent chain: Parser → Classifier → Validator
4. Conditional routing to classification-specific validators
5. Multi-hub audit logging of all classification decisions
6. HTTP response with classification, confidence, evidence, and execution trace

**Business Value**:
- Production-ready classification service for immediate deployment
- Complete observability of classification decisions
- Confidence scoring for reliability assessment
- Audit trail meeting security requirements
- Reference architecture for future agent-powered services

**Deliverable**: Document classification service as containerized, production-ready application
