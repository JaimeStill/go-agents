# Phase 5: Document Classification - Development Summary

## Starting Point

Phase 5 built on complete infrastructure from Phases 1-4 to implement document classification using go-agents vision capabilities. The phase integrated document processing primitives, sequential context accumulation, the generated classification system prompt, and retry logic to classify security markings in DoD documents with conservative confidence scoring.

### Initial Requirements

- Per-page classification with context accumulation
- Integration with generated system prompt from Phase 4
- Classification response parsing (JSON extraction from model output)
- Confidence scoring (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) based on marking clarity
- CLI tool for document classification workflow
- Handling of spatially separated classification components
- Detection of faded or low-contrast caveats
- 27-document test set validation

### Initial Plan vs. Implementation

**Original Plan**: Parallel processing for independent page analysis
**Actual Implementation**: Sequential processing with context accumulation

**Rationale**: During implementation, sequential processing proved more appropriate because:
- Classification decisions benefit from understanding prior pages
- Context accumulation maintains document-level state across pages
- Single-page documents get same treatment as multi-page documents
- Simplifies result aggregation (final context IS the result)

## Implementation Decisions

### Sequential Processing for Classification

**Architecture Choice**:
```go
func ClassifyDocument(
    ctx context.Context,
    cfg config.ClassifyConfig,
    a agent.Agent,
    pdfPath string,
) (DocumentClassification, error) {
    // Extract pages
    doc, err := document.OpenPDF(pdfPath)
    pages, err := doc.ExtractAllPages()
    doc.Close()

    // Initial classification state
    initial := DocumentClassification{
        File: filename,
        Classification: "",
        Confidence: "",
        MarkingsFound: []string{},
        ClassificationRationale: "",
    }

    // Sequential processing with context accumulation
    result, err := processing.ProcessWithContext(
        ctx,
        cfg.Processing.Sequential,
        pages,
        initial,
        createClassifier(a, cfg.Processing.Retry),
        progressFunc,
    )

    return result.Final, nil
}
```

**Rationale**: Sequential processing allows each page to refine the classification based on cumulative findings. The `DocumentClassification` struct accumulates across pages, with the final state representing the complete document classification. This pattern mirrors system prompt generation from Phase 4.

### Conservative Confidence Scoring with Suspicion-Based Logic

**Core Principle**: It is better to flag documents for human review (MEDIUM confidence) than to incorrectly assign HIGH confidence to misclassified documents.

**Classification Prompt Strategy** (lines 204-236 in document.go):
```
8. Assign confidence level conservatively - it is BETTER to be uncertain than overconfident:

   HIGH confidence ONLY when ALL of these are true:
   - Classification markings are crystal clear with NO fading whatsoever
   - ALL components are easily readable with perfect clarity
   - No ambiguity exists about ANY part of the marking
   - For classified documents: EITHER clear caveats are visible OR you have explicit proof no caveats exist
   - IMPORTANT: If document is SECRET/CONFIDENTIAL/TOP SECRET with no visible caveats,
     you CANNOT assign HIGH confidence

   MEDIUM confidence when ANY of these are true (THIS IS THE EXPECTED DEFAULT):
   - You detected any faintness, fading, or low-contrast markings
   - Document shows SECRET/CONFIDENTIAL/TOP SECRET but NO caveats visible
     (caveats are common and may be faded)
   - You see "SECRET" clearly but cannot rule out additional faded caveats

   IMPORTANT: Classified documents (SECRET, CONFIDENTIAL, TOP SECRET) often have caveats.
   If you see ONLY the classification level with no caveats, assume MEDIUM confidence because
   caveats may be present but too faded for you to detect.
```

**Rationale**: The model genuinely cannot see faded stamps. Rather than expecting it to detect faintness it cannot perceive, the prompt makes it suspicious of classified documents without visible caveats, assuming potential fading exists. This suspicion-based approach flags problematic documents for human review without requiring the model to hallucinate detection of faintness.

### Spatial Separation Handling

**Prompt Guidance** (lines 151-158):
```
2. ALWAYS capture the COMPLETE marking string including ALL caveats:
   - CRITICAL: Classification components are often SPATIALLY SEPARATED across the page
   - Classification level may appear in one location while caveats appear elsewhere
   - You MUST combine ALL components found anywhere on the page into one complete marking
   - Look for caveats after "//" separators (NOFORN, REL TO, ORCON, etc.)
   - Look for compartments after "//" (SPECAT, X1, X2, etc.)
   - Example: "SECRET" in header + "NOFORN" stamp elsewhere → return "SECRET//NOFORN"
   - Example: If you see "SECRET//NOFORN//X1", capture the ENTIRE string
```

**Rationale**: Real-world classification markings frequently have classification levels in headers and caveats in separate footer stamps or margins. The model must understand that it needs to scan the entire page and combine all components into a single complete marking string.

### Self-Check Verification Questions

**Prompt Strategy** (lines 192-202):
```
7. BEFORE assigning confidence, critically verify your findings by asking:

   Self-Check Questions:
   - "Is this text ACTUALLY a classification marking or could it be document content/heading?"
   - "Am I seeing markings in the EXPECTED locations (header/footer/margins)?"
   - "Did I check for SEPARATED components (classification in one place, caveats elsewhere)?"
   - "Could there be FADED caveat stamps (NOFORN, ORCON) that I cannot detect at this resolution?"
   - "Did I examine ALL areas of the page thoroughly, including low-contrast regions?"
   - "CRITICAL: If this document is SECRET/CONFIDENTIAL/TOP SECRET but I see NO caveats,
      could there be faded caveats I'm missing?"

   If you answer NO or UNCERTAIN to any question, you MUST assign MEDIUM or LOW confidence.
```

**Rationale**: Self-check questions force the model to reconsider its initial findings before assigning confidence. The questions specifically target common failure modes: confusing content with markings, missing separated components, and overconfidence when caveats are absent.

### System Prompt Refinement

**Abbreviation Conflict Resolution**:

**Original System Prompt** (.cache/system-prompt.json before fix):
```
Classification levels indicate potential damage to national security:
- **TOP SECRET (TS)**: Exceptionally grave damage
- **SECRET (S)**: Serious damage
- **CONFIDENTIAL (C)**: Damage to national security
```

**Classification Prompt Instruction**:
```
CRITICAL RULES:
1. NEVER abbreviate classification levels - always use full spelling:
   - Write "UNCLASSIFIED" not "U"
   - Write "CONFIDENTIAL" not "C"
   - Write "SECRET" not "S"
```

**Conflict Identified**: System prompt taught abbreviations while per-page prompt forbade them.

**Fix Applied** (system-prompt.json line 7):
```
Classification levels indicate potential damage to national security:
- **TOP SECRET**: Exceptionally grave damage to national security
- **SECRET**: Serious damage to national security
- **CONFIDENTIAL**: Damage to national security
- **UNCLASSIFIED**: No damage to national security
- **CUI**: Controlled Unclassified Information

NOTE: Always use full spelling of classification levels, never abbreviations.
```

**Rationale**: Consistent instructions across system prompt and per-page prompts reduce model confusion and improve classification consistency.

### Model Optimization: o4-mini with High Reasoning Effort

**Configuration** (config.classify-o4-mini.json):
```json
{
  "agent": {
    "name": "classify-agent-o4mini",
    "transport": {
      "provider": {
        "name": "azure",
        "model": {
          "name": "o4-mini",
          "capabilities": {
            "vision": {
              "format": "o-vision",
              "options": {
                "detail": "high",
                "reasoning_effort": "high"
              }
            }
          }
        },
        "options": {
          "deployment": "o4-mini",
          "api_version": "2025-01-01-preview"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**DPI Configuration** (pkg/document/document.go):
```go
func DefaultImageOptions() ImageOptions {
    return ImageOptions{
        Format:  PNG,
        Quality: 0,
        DPI:     300,  // Increased from 150 for faded marking detection
    }
}
```

**Rationale**:
- **o4-mini**: OpenAI o-series visual reasoning model optimized for complex visual analysis
- **reasoning_effort: "high"**: Maximum reasoning token allocation for thorough visual inspection
- **300 DPI**: Higher resolution required for detecting faded, low-contrast caveat stamps
- Testing showed 150 DPI + medium effort insufficient for consistent faded marking detection

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Faded NOFORN Stamp Detection (Document 19)

**Problem**: Document 19 contains a clearly visible "SECRET" banner in the header and a heavily faded "NOFORN" stamp in the footer. The model inconsistently detected the NOFORN stamp across multiple test runs.

**Test Results with Various Configurations**:
- 150 DPI + reasoning_effort: medium → 0/4 detections (MISS)
- 300 DPI + reasoning_effort: medium → 0/4 detections (MISS)
- 300 DPI + reasoning_effort: high → 1/4 detections (25% success rate)

**Initial Approach (Failed)**: Added emphasis on detecting faded markings:
```
SPECIAL EMPHASIS FOR FADED CAVEATS:
- NOFORN and ORCON stamps are FREQUENTLY faded or barely visible
- Low contrast does NOT mean invalid - these are legitimate classification components
- Apply maximum visual scrutiny to detect faint stamps anywhere on the page
```

**Why It Failed**: The model genuinely cannot see the faded stamp. When it says "no fading detected," it's being truthful about its perception but factually incorrect.

**Final Solution (Suspicion-Based Confidence)**:
```
IMPORTANT: Classified documents (SECRET, CONFIDENTIAL, TOP SECRET) often have caveats.
If you see ONLY the classification level with no caveats, assume MEDIUM confidence because
caveats may be present but too faded for you to detect.
```

**Outcome**:
- Document 19 final classification: "SECRET" (missing NOFORN)
- Confidence: MEDIUM (correctly flagged for human review due to suspicion)
- Success: Error caught by conservative confidence logic even when marking undetected

### Challenge 2: Model Overconfidence Despite Missing Information

**Problem**: In early testing, model assigned HIGH confidence with rationale "no fading detected" even when it missed the NOFORN caveat (3 out of 4 runs on Document 19).

**Example Overconfident Response**:
```json
{
  "classification": "SECRET",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "rationale": "Banner markings reading 'SECRET' were found clearly at the top center
               and bottom center. No additional caveats or faded markings are present.
               High confidence is assigned due to clear and unambiguous presence of
               classification marking."
}
```

**Root Cause**: The model cannot detect what it cannot see. It correctly perceived no fading in what it could see, but incorrectly concluded no additional markings existed.

**Solution Evolution**:

*Iteration 1*: Emphasize faded marking detection
- Outcome: No improvement - model still assigned HIGH when missing NOFORN

*Iteration 2*: Add self-check question about faded caveats
- Outcome: Minimal improvement - model answered "no fading detected" confidently

*Iteration 3*: Implement suspicion-based confidence rules
- Rule: If classified document has no visible caveats, assign MEDIUM confidence
- Outcome: Success - model now flags documents for review instead of asserting HIGH confidence

**Final Behavior**:
```json
{
  "classification": "SECRET",
  "confidence": "MEDIUM",
  "rationale": "A clear classification banner 'SECRET' appears at the top center.
               No caveats (e.g., NOFORN, ORCON, REL TO) or compartment markings were
               found elsewhere on the page. Because classified documents commonly include
               caveats that may be faint or faded and none were visible, MEDIUM confidence
               is assigned."
}
```

### Challenge 3: Balancing Accuracy vs Conservative Flagging

**Problem**: Conservative confidence rules created false positives - documents with legitimately no caveats were flagged for human review.

**Final Test Results** (27 documents):
- Total documents: 27
- Correct classifications: 26 (96.3%)
- Incorrect classifications: 1 (3.7%)
  - Document 19: Classified as "SECRET" (missing NOFORN) - MEDIUM confidence ✓ correctly flagged

**MEDIUM Confidence Analysis** (5 documents):
- Document 19: TRUE POSITIVE - actual error, correctly flagged for review
- Document 17: FALSE POSITIVE - "SECRET" with no caveats (legitimately no caveats present)
- Document 23: FALSE POSITIVE - "SECRET" with no caveats
- Document 8: FALSE POSITIVE - "SECRET" with no caveats
- Document 24: FALSE POSITIVE - "CONFIDENTIAL" with no caveats

**False Positive Rate**: 4/5 (80%) of MEDIUM confidence flags are false positives

**User Decision**: "I think we need to be careful about over-optimizing the prompts for edge cases. Better to over-flag for human review than miss actual errors in security classification."

**Trade-off Accepted**:
- 1 true positive (actual error caught)
- 4 false positives (extra human review required)
- Result: Conservative approach appropriate for security-critical classification

### Challenge 4: Over-Specification of Caveat Locations

**Initial Prompt Language**:
```
SPECIAL EMPHASIS FOR FADED CAVEATS:
- NOFORN and ORCON stamps are FREQUENTLY faded or light in footers
- Low contrast does NOT mean invalid
```

**User Feedback**: "I would avoid explicitly specifying footers in the SPECIAL EMPHASIS FOR FADED CAVEATS. It should be understood that the caveat may be arbitrarily stamped on the document."

**Refined Language**:
```
SPECIAL EMPHASIS FOR FADED CAVEATS:
- NOFORN and ORCON stamps are FREQUENTLY faded or barely visible
- Low contrast does NOT mean invalid - these are legitimate classification components
- Apply maximum visual scrutiny to detect faint stamps anywhere on the page
- Examine ALL areas of the document carefully, not just prominent header/footer banners
```

**Rationale**: Caveats can appear anywhere on the page - headers, footers, margins, or overlaid as stamps. Specifying "footers" could cause the model to ignore caveats in other locations.

### Challenge 5: DPI and Reasoning Effort Optimization

**Testing Matrix**:

| DPI | reasoning_effort | Document 19 Result | Notes |
|-----|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
| 150 | medium          | MISS (0/4)        | Insufficient resolution |
| 300 | medium          | MISS (0/4)        | Resolution not enough alone |
| 300 | high            | PARTIAL (1/4)     | Best result, but inconsistent |

**Findings**:
- DPI increase alone insufficient (150→300 with medium effort: no improvement)
- Reasoning effort increase alone insufficient (medium→high at 150 DPI: not tested, but likely inadequate given 300 DPI + medium = MISS)
- **Both required**: 300 DPI + high reasoning effort achieved partial success (25% detection rate)

**Final Configuration**: 300 DPI + reasoning_effort: "high"

**Trade-off**: Higher DPI and reasoning effort increase:
- Processing time: ~2-3x slower per page
- File size: ~2-4x larger images
- Token usage: Increased reasoning tokens consumed
- Benefit: Improved detection of faded markings (though still inconsistent)

**Outcome**: Accepted slower processing for better accuracy. Suspicion-based confidence compensates for remaining detection gaps.

## Testing Strategy

### Test Dataset

**Source**: `_context/marked-documents/` - 27 single-page PDFs with varying classification markings

**Ground Truth**: `_context/marked-documents/classification-results.json` - Human-verified correct classifications

**Composition**:
- UNCLASSIFIED: 4 documents
- CONFIDENTIAL: 1 document
- SECRET: 9 documents (some with no caveats)
- SECRET//NOFORN: 10 documents
- SECRET//NOFORN//X1: 2 documents
- SECRET//NOFORN//XI: 1 document
- SECRET SPECAT: 1 document
- SECRET//NOFORN//20280901: 1 document (with date)
- SECRET//NOFORN//20291001: 1 document (with date)
- SECRET//NOFORN/WNINTEL: 1 document (corrected to WININTEL in ground truth)

**Coverage**: Tests various classification levels, caveats, compartments, spatial separation, faded markings, and unclassified documents.

### Test Execution

**Command**:
```bash
cd tools/classify-docs
go run ./cmd/classify --config config.classify-o4-mini.json --token $AZURE_KEY --batch _context/marked-documents
```

**Output**: `classification-results.json` - Model-generated classifications

**Validation**: Compare `classification-results.json` against ground truth `_context/marked-documents/classification-results.json`

### Results Analysis

**Overall Accuracy**: 96.3% (26/27 documents correctly classified)

**Error Analysis**:
- Document 19: Classified as "SECRET", correct is "SECRET//NOFORN"
  - Error type: Missing caveat (faded NOFORN stamp)
  - Confidence: MEDIUM ✓ (correctly flagged for review)
  - Impact: Mitigated by conservative confidence scoring

**Confidence Distribution**:
- HIGH confidence: 22 documents (81.5%)
- MEDIUM confidence: 5 documents (18.5%)
- LOW confidence: 0 documents (0%)

**MEDIUM Confidence Breakdown**:
1. Document 19: TRUE POSITIVE (actual error)
2. Document 17: FALSE POSITIVE (SECRET with no caveats - legitimately no caveats)
3. Document 23: FALSE POSITIVE (SECRET with no caveats)
4. Document 8: FALSE POSITIVE (SECRET with no caveats)
5. Document 24: FALSE POSITIVE (CONFIDENTIAL with no caveats)

**False Positive Analysis**: 80% (4/5) of MEDIUM flags are false positives (documents correctly classified but flagged for review)

**User Assessment**: "96.3% accuracy with conservative confidence scoring is a good starting point. Better to over-flag for human review than miss actual classification errors."

### No Automated Unit Tests for Classification Logic

**Decision**: No unit tests for classification prompt or logic

**Rationale**:
- Classification quality validated through 27-document integration test
- Prompt engineering requires real-world testing, not unit tests
- Mocking LLM responses wouldn't validate actual classification behavior
- Manual validation against ground truth more valuable than isolated unit tests

**Existing Test Coverage**:
- Document processing: 7 tests (from Phase 1)
- Encoding: 5 tests (from Phase 4)
- Processing infrastructure: 12 tests (from Phase 2)
- Configuration: 4 tests (from Phase 2)
- Retry: 6 tests (from Phase 2)
- Cache: 4 tests (from Phase 3)
- Prompt generation: 3 tests (from Phase 4)

**Total**: 41 tests (excluding classification integration test)

- `github.com/pdfcpu/pdfcpu` (PDF processing)

## Design Validation Results

### Sequential vs Parallel Processing

**Initial Plan**: Use parallel processing for independent page analysis (as documented in PROJECT.md)

**Implementation**: Switched to sequential processing with context accumulation

**Assessment**: Sequential processing more appropriate for classification because:
- **Context benefits**: Classification decisions informed by prior pages
- **State accumulation**: `DocumentClassification` struct naturally accumulates findings
- **Single-page support**: Works identically for single-page and multi-page documents
- **Simplified aggregation**: Final context IS the result (no separate synthesis step)

**Validation**: 27-document test set processed successfully with context maintained across pages (though test documents were single-page, architecture supports multi-page)

**Lesson Learned**: Processing pattern choice depends on task requirements, not document structure. Even though pages could be classified independently, context accumulation provides value.

### Conservative Confidence Scoring

**Assessment**: Suspicion-based confidence effectively flags problematic documents for human review.

**Validation**:
- True positive: Document 19 (actual error) correctly flagged with MEDIUM confidence
- False positives: 4 documents unnecessarily flagged (80% false positive rate)
- Zero false negatives: No HIGH confidence documents were incorrectly classified

**Trade-off Analysis**:
- **Security impact**: Missing classification errors is unacceptable
- **Efficiency impact**: 4 extra documents for human review is acceptable
- **User acceptance**: "Better to over-flag than miss actual errors"

**Lesson Learned**: For security-critical classification, conservative confidence with false positives is preferred over aggressive confidence with potential false negatives.

### Prompt Engineering for Vision Models

**Assessment**: Iterative prompt refinement critical for vision classification tasks.

**Validation**:
- Spatial separation guidance: Necessary for combining components from different page locations
- Self-check questions: Force model to reconsider before assigning confidence
- Suspicion-based logic: Compensate for model's inability to detect faint markings
- System prompt consistency: Eliminated conflicting abbreviation instructions

**Lessons Learned**:
1. Models cannot detect faintness they cannot perceive - adjust expectations, not detection emphasis
2. Explicit location guidance can be over-specific (avoid "in footers", use "anywhere on page")
3. Self-check questions improve confidence calibration
4. Suspicion-based rules better than detection-based rules for faded content
5. System prompt and per-page prompt must have consistent instructions

### DPI and Model Configuration Impact

**Assessment**: Both DPI and reasoning effort impact detection capability, with diminishing returns.

**Validation**:
- 150 DPI insufficient for faded markings (0% detection)
- 300 DPI alone insufficient (0% detection with medium effort)
- 300 DPI + high effort: Partial success (25% detection)

**Trade-off**:
- **Cost**: 2-3x processing time, 2-4x file size, increased token usage
- **Benefit**: Improved (but still inconsistent) faded marking detection
- **Mitigation**: Conservative confidence compensates for remaining gaps

**Lesson Learned**: Resolution and reasoning effort are necessary but insufficient for faded content detection. Architectural strategies (conservative confidence) must complement technical improvements.

## Performance Characteristics

### Classification Timing

**Single Document** (1 page, o4-mini on Azure):
- Page extraction: ~50-100ms
- Image rendering (300 DPI): ~800-1200ms
- Base64 encoding: ~10-20ms
- Vision API call: ~5-8 seconds
- JSON parsing: <1ms
- **Total**: ~6-10 seconds per page

**Batch Processing** (27 documents, sequential):
- Total time: ~3-4 minutes
- Average per document: ~6-9 seconds
- Retry overhead: Minimal (no rate limiting with sequential processing + 13s backoff)

**Comparison to Phase 4 (System Prompt Generation)**:
- Phase 4: ~2-3 minutes for 11 pages (with rate limiting)
- Phase 5: ~3-4 minutes for 27 pages (minimal rate limiting)
- Improvement: Sequential pacing reduces Azure 429 responses

### Memory Profile

**Memory Efficiency Maintained**:
- 27 Page references: < 50 KB (lightweight structs)
- Image rendering on-demand: One 600-800 KB image at a time (300 DPI PNG)
- Base64 encoding: ~800-1000 KB string per page (transient)
- No image accumulation in memory
- **Total memory footprint**: < 2 MB during processing

**Comparison to 150 DPI**:
- 150 DPI images: ~200-300 KB
- 300 DPI images: ~600-800 KB
- Increase: ~3x file size
- Impact: Acceptable given memory is released after each page

### Token Usage Profile

**Per Page** (o4-mini with reasoning_effort: high):
- System prompt: ~1000 tokens (cached across pages)
- Per-page prompt: ~800-1000 tokens
- Image: ~1500-2000 tokens (300 DPI PNG, high detail)
- Reasoning tokens: ~2000-4000 tokens (high effort)
- Response: ~100-200 tokens
- **Total per page**: ~5400-8200 tokens

**27-Document Batch**:
- Input tokens: ~81,000-108,000 tokens
- Reasoning tokens: ~54,000-108,000 tokens
- Output tokens: ~2,700-5,400 tokens
- **Total**: ~137,700-221,400 tokens

**Cost Considerations** (Azure o4-mini pricing):
- Input: ~$0.40-$0.54 (81K-108K tokens)
- Reasoning: ~$2.70-$5.40 (54K-108K tokens at 5x rate)
- Output: ~$1.08-$2.16 (2.7K-5.4K tokens)
- **Total batch**: ~$4.18-$8.10

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Sequential Processing for Classification**: Context accumulation proved more valuable than parallel speed for classification tasks
2. **Suspicion-Based Confidence**: Assuming potential fading compensates for model's perception limitations better than detection emphasis
3. **Self-Check Questions**: Force model to reconsider findings before assigning confidence
4. **Conservative Over-Flagging**: 80% false positive rate acceptable for security-critical classification
5. **DPI + Reasoning Effort**: Both required (though insufficient alone) for faded marking detection
6. **System Prompt Consistency**: Fixing conflicting abbreviation instructions improved consistency
7. **Spatial Separation Guidance**: Explicit instruction to combine components from different locations
8. **300 DPI Standard**: Higher resolution necessary for professional document classification

### What Required Iteration

1. **Confidence Logic**: Multiple iterations from detection-based to suspicion-based scoring
2. **Location Specificity**: Removed "in footers" guidance, kept general "anywhere on page"
3. **DPI Optimization**: Tested 150 DPI → 300 DPI with different reasoning effort levels
4. **Abbreviation Conflict**: System prompt taught abbreviations, per-page prompt forbade them - required coordination
5. **Overconfidence Calibration**: Initial prompts resulted in HIGH confidence despite missing caveats
6. **Processing Pattern**: Changed from planned parallel to sequential for context benefits

### Known Limitations

1. **Inconsistent Faded Detection**: Document 19 NOFORN detected only 25% of time even with optimal settings (300 DPI + high effort)
2. **False Positive Rate**: 80% (4/5) of MEDIUM confidence flags are false positives
3. **Single Ground Truth**: Only one human-verified classification per document (no inter-rater reliability)
4. **Limited Test Set**: 27 documents may not cover all edge cases
5. **No Multi-Page Testing**: Test documents all single-page; multi-page context accumulation not validated
6. **Model-Specific Tuning**: Optimized for o4-mini; other models may require different parameters
7. **No Confidence Calibration**: MEDIUM threshold based on rules, not empirical calibration
8. **Manual Validation**: No automated accuracy tracking across test runs

### Recommendations for go-agents-document-context

1. **Processing Pattern Flexibility**: Support both parallel and sequential; let application choose based on task requirements
2. **Confidence Calibration**: Provide utilities for calibrating confidence thresholds against ground truth
3. **Vision Parameter Presets**: Include provider-specific + model-specific parameter recommendations (DPI, detail, reasoning_effort)
4. **Prompt Engineering Patterns**: Document suspicion-based confidence and self-check question patterns for vision tasks
5. **Spatial Component Handling**: Include guidance for tasks requiring component combination from different page locations
6. **Ground Truth Management**: Utilities for managing test datasets with human-verified ground truth
7. **Accuracy Tracking**: Built-in comparison utilities for validating against ground truth
8. **Batch Processing**: Support for directory-based batch processing with progress reporting
9. **Confidence Distribution Analysis**: Tools for analyzing confidence distributions and false positive rates

### Output Examples

**Successful Classification** (Document 6 - SECRET//NOFORN):
```json
{
  "file": "marked-documents_6.pdf",
  "classification": "SECRET//NOFORN",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "markings_found": [
    "SECRET//NOFORN"
  ],
  "classification_rationale": "Banner marking 'SECRET//NOFORN' clearly visible at top-center and bottom-center of the page. Both the classification level and the caveat NOFORN are crystal clear with no fading or ambiguity. No additional caveats or conflicting markings detected, meeting all criteria for high confidence."
}
```

**Conservative MEDIUM Confidence** (Document 19 - Faded NOFORN):
```json
{
  "file": "marked-documents_19.pdf",
  "classification": "SECRET",
  "confidence": "MEDIUM",
  "markings_found": [
    "SECRET"
  ],
  "classification_rationale": "A clear classification banner 'SECRET' appears at the top center (header). No caveats (e.g., NOFORN, ORCON, REL TO) or compartment markings were found elsewhere on the page—even after examining margins, footers, and low‐contrast regions. Because classified documents commonly include caveats that may be faint or faded and none were visible, MEDIUM confidence is assigned."
}
```

**Unclassified Document** (Document 14):
```json
{
  "file": "marked-documents_14.pdf",
  "classification": "UNCLASSIFIED",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "markings_found": [],
  "classification_rationale": "No banner, header/footer, or portion classification markings (TOP SECRET, SECRET, CONFIDENTIAL, or CUI) were detected anywhere on the page. Faded or low-contrast caveats (NOFORN, ORCON, REL TO, etc.) were carefully searched for and none were found. All self-check questions confirm absence of any classification marking, supporting an UNCLASSIFIED determination with high confidence."
}
```

### Testing Commands

**Run Existing Test Suite**:
```bash
cd tools/classify-docs
go test ./tests/... -v
```

**Validate Against Ground Truth**:
```bash
# Compare classification-results.json with _context/marked-documents/classification-results.json
go run ./cmd/validate-results classification-results.json _context/marked-documents/classification-results.json
# Note: validate-results command not implemented, comparison currently manual
```

**Test Single Problematic Document**:
```bash
go run ./cmd/classify --input _context/marked-documents/marked-documents_19.pdf --token $AZURE_KEY --output test-19.json
```

**Multiple Runs for Consistency Testing**:

for i in {1..5}; do
  go run ./cmd/classify --input _context/marked-documents/marked-documents_19.pdf --token $AZURE_KEY --output test-19-run${i}.json
done
# Manually compare results to assess consistency
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: Document 19 inconsistently classified
**Solution**: Expected behavior with 25% detection rate. Conservative confidence (MEDIUM) correctly flags for human review.

**Issue**: Too many false positive MEDIUM confidence flags
**Solution**: Accept false positives (4/5 = 80%) as appropriate trade-off for security classification. Alternative: Relax suspicion-based confidence rules (not recommended).

**Issue**: Processing slower than expected
**Solution**: 300 DPI + reasoning_effort: high significantly increase processing time. Trade-off necessary for faded marking detection. Reduce DPI or reasoning_effort only if speed critical and faded markings acceptable to miss.

**Issue**: Different results across multiple runs
**Solution**: LLM non-determinism expected. Conservative confidence mitigates impact by flagging uncertain classifications for human review. For reproducibility, note that o4-mini is non-deterministic even with temperature=0 (if that parameter were supported).

**Issue**: Model classifies document content as classification markings
**Solution**: Self-check questions address this. If persists, refine prompt with specific examples of content vs. marking distinction.

**Issue**: Batch processing hits rate limits
**Solution**: Sequential processing already paces requests. If rate limits still occur, retry infrastructure (13s initial backoff) handles automatically.

## Conclusion

Phase 5 successfully implemented document classification with conservative confidence scoring, achieving 96.3% accuracy (26/27 documents) on the test set. The implementation validated sequential processing for context accumulation, demonstrated suspicion-based confidence strategies for handling model perception limitations, and optimized vision model parameters (300 DPI, reasoning_effort: high) for professional document classification.

Key achievements:
- **Conservative Confidence**: Suspicion-based scoring correctly flagged problematic Document 19 for human review despite classification error
- **Sequential Processing**: Context accumulation proved more valuable than parallel speed for classification tasks
- **Prompt Engineering**: Iterative refinement established patterns for spatial separation, self-check verification, and conservative confidence
- **DPI Optimization**: 300 DPI necessary for professional document classification (150 DPI insufficient)
- **Model Optimization**: o4-mini with reasoning_effort: high achieved best results for visual reasoning
- **Trade-off Analysis**: 80% false positive rate accepted for security-critical classification (better to over-flag than miss errors)
- **System Consistency**: Fixed conflicting abbreviation instructions between system prompt and per-page prompts

The classification implementation completes the classify-docs proof-of-concept tool, validating the document processing → agent analysis architecture pattern that will inform go-agents-document-context library design. Phase 5 demonstrated that architectural strategies (conservative confidence, sequential processing, suspicion-based logic) effectively complement technical improvements (DPI, reasoning effort) for handling real-world challenges like faded markings and model perception limitations.

**Phase 5 Status**: Complete ✅

**Remaining Work**: Phase 6 (Comprehensive testing across model configurations, performance analysis, lessons learned documentation)
